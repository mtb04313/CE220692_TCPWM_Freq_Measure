# CE220692 – PSoC 6 MCU Frequency Measurement Using TCPWM
## Ported to Modus Toolbox

The original CE220692 was written for PSoC Creator.  This has now been ported to Modus Toolbox and tested on the PSoC 6 Prototyping Kit.

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade;](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.1 or later (tested with v3.1)
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version for:
   - PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: v4.2.0
   - CYW920829M2EVK-02: v1.0.1
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: All [PSoC&trade; 6 MCU](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex-microcontroller/psoc-6-32-bit-arm-cortex-m4-mcu) parts,[XMC7000 MCU](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-industrial-microcontroller-based-on-arm-cortex-m/) and [AIROC&trade; CYW20829 Bluetooth&reg; LE SoC](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/airoc20829)


## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v11.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) – Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.16 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ Compiler v9.30.1 (`IAR`)


## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; Prototyping Kit](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CPROTO-062-4343W) (`CY8CPROTO-062-4343W`)

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.
Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.



## Using the code example

In a command-line Terminal:

1. clone the project 

   <b>git clone https://github.com/mtb04313/CE220692_TCPWM_Freq_Measure.git</b>

2. download dependencies 

   <b>make getlibs</b>

3. compile 

   <b>make build</b>

4. (optional) run Modus Toolbox and choose `Import Application in-place`



## Operation


1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically.
